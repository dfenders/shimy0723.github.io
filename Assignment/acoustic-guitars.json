        "description": "<p>It’s hard to beat Martin when it comes to building a premium acoustic guitar and, while the D-16RGT may not be one of their higher-end models, it certainly ticks all our boxes. Good-looking? Tick. Smooth playability? Tick. Beautiful rich tone? Tick!</p> <p> Made entirely from solid wood – Sitka spruce on the top and East Indian rosewood on the back and sides – the overall feeling of quality you get from this American-made Martin is overwhelming. The tone of the elegant dreadnought is big and booming, but bright and well-balanced.</p> <p>Features include a sleek satin-finished neck, the use of eco-friendly Richlite for the fretboard, solid hardware, and a great Martin hardshell case. Check out everything about the Martin D-16RGT in the full review.</p>"
