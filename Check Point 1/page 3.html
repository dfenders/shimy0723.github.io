    <h2>Random fact 1</h2>

<h3>Charles Darwin’s personal pet tortoise didn’t die until recently.</h3>
<p>Okay, technically she wasn’t his pet, but after his tour of the Galapagos Islands, Charles Darwin brought back a five-year-old tortoise he named Harriet. She outlived her adopter by 124 years, ultimately making it to a whopping 176 years old. Harriet lived out her final years as part of the family of Steve “Crocodile Hunter” Irwin in Australia, until she passed away, in 2006.

<h3>The average person will spend six months of their life waiting for red lights to turn green</h3>
<p>Driving can be a fun and liberating activity—until you get stuck at a red light, that is. The National Association of City Transportation Officials says that the average time spent waiting at a red light is 75 seconds, accounting for approximately 20 percent of all driving time. That’s a whole lot of time doing nothing and just another reason to switch to public transportation.  </p>
